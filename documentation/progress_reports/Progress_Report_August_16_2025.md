# 🚀 Semantic Search Agent - Progress Report
**Date:** August 16, 2025  
**Milestone:** Stage 1 Foundation Complete  
**Project Status:** ✅ Data Collection Infrastructure Established

---

## 📋 **Project Overview**

**Goal:** Build an AI-powered research assistant that autonomously mines, clusters, and summarizes fitness-related user pain points from Reddit posts. Unlike a static search tool, this system operates as an agent — it reasons over the user's goal, selects the right tools (semantic search, clustering, summarization, trend analysis), and executes multi-step workflows to return actionable insights grounded in real user discussions.

**Current Stage:** Stage 1 - Core Technical Foundations  
**Learning Approach:** Top-down, portfolio-focused development with strategic AI assistance

---

## ✅ **Completed Components**

### **🎯 Chunk 1: Data Collection (COMPLETE)**

#### **Core Infrastructure:**
- ✅ **Virtual Environment Setup** - `venv` with all dependencies
- ✅ **Reddit API Integration** - PRAW-based collector with authentication
- ✅ **Environment Management** - `.env` for secrets, `.gitignore` for security
- ✅ **Git Repository** - Successfully pushed to GitHub with clean history

#### **Data Collection Engine (`reddit_collector.py`):**
```python
# Key Features Implemented:
✅ Reddit API Authentication (read-only access)
✅ Subreddit Post Collection (configurable time periods)
✅ Hierarchical Comment Extraction (all thread levels)
✅ Pain Point Detection System (keyword-based scoring)
✅ Rate Limiting & Progress Tracking
✅ Multiple Export Formats (JSONL, CSV)
✅ Error Handling & Logging
```

#### **Advanced Comment Analysis:**
- **📊 Comment Classification:** Categorizes comments as `pain_point`, `question`, `advice`, `detailed_response`, or `general`
- **🎯 Pain Point Scoring:** 0.0-1.0 scale based on pain indicators, first-person language, and length
- **🔗 Semantic Text Creation:** Combines post context with comment body for rich embeddings
- **📈 Hierarchical Structure:** Captures `parent_id`, `depth`, and thread relationships
- **⚡ Smart Prioritization:** Combines pain point score (60%), Reddit score (30%), and length (10%)

## 📊 **Data Collection Results**

### **Sample Data Collected:**
- **Source:** r/Fitness subreddit
- **Posts:** 2 sample posts with full metadata
- **Comments:** Multi-level comment threads with pain point analysis
- **Time Range:** Recent posts from August 2025

### **Data Structure Example:**
```json
{
  "id": "1mozb38",
  "title": "Rant Wednesday - August 13, 2025",
  "comments": [
    {
      "comment_id": "n8g1m3u",
      "body": "Employees at my gym decided to machine sand...",
      "pain_point_score": 0.2,
      "comment_type": "detailed_response",
      "semantic_text": "Post: Rant Wednesday... | Comment: Employees at my gym..."
    }
  ]
}
```

### **Pain Point Detection Examples:**
- **High Score (0.4+):** Training struggles, equipment issues, gym frustrations
- **Medium Score (0.2-0.4):** General complaints, workout challenges
- **Low Score (0.0-0.2):** Casual comments, humor, general discussion

## 🛠 **Technical Implementation Details**

### **Authentication & Security:**
```bash
# Environment Setup
REDDIT_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here
REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret_here
REDDIT_USER_AGENT=YourAppName/1.0 by your_reddit_username
```

### **Rate Limiting Strategy:**
- **With Comments:** 0.2 seconds between requests
- **Without Comments:** 0.1 seconds between requests
- **API Respect:** Read-only access, no data modification

### **Error Handling:**
- ✅ Network timeout protection
- ✅ Deleted/removed comment filtering
- ✅ API quota management
- ✅ Graceful degradation on failures
