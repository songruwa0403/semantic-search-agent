# 🚀 Semantic Search Agent - Progress Report
**Date:** December 19, 2024  
**Milestone:** Stage 2 Complete + Major Project Reorganization  
**Project Status:** ✅ Data Collection & Cleaning Infrastructure Complete

---

## 📋 **Project Overview Recap**

**Goal:** Build an AI-powered research assistant that autonomously mines, clusters, and summarizes fitness-related user pain points from Reddit posts. Unlike a static search tool, this system operates as an agent — it reasons over the user's goal, selects the right tools (semantic search, clustering, summarization, trend analysis), and executes multi-step workflows to return actionable insights grounded in real user discussions.

**Current Stage:** Stage 2 Complete - Ready for Stage 3 (Semantic Embeddings)  
**Development Approach:** MVP-focused, portfolio-ready, top-down learning

- ✅ **Multiple chunking strategies** - Semantic text, posts, comments, and mixed approaches
- ✅ **Rich feature engineering** - Text statistics, content detection, quality scoring
- ✅ **Comprehensive error handling** - Graceful degradation and detailed logging

#### **Advanced Text Processing:**
```python
# Key cleaning capabilities implemented:
✅ Reddit-specific formatting (u/username → [USER], r/subreddit → [SUBREDDIT])
✅ URL handling (https://... → [URL] with context preservation)
✅ HTML entity decoding and tag removal
✅ Smart whitespace normalization
✅ Deleted/removed content filtering
✅ Emoji preservation (meaningful in fitness context)
