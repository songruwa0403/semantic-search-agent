- **Request/Response Design**: Clean schemas for complex agent interactions
- **Concurrent Processing**: Handle multiple agent sessions simultaneously
- **API Documentation**: Auto-generated docs with OpenAPI/Swagger

#### **API Endpoints Design**
```python
# Core agent interaction
POST /agent/query
{
    "query": "Find equipment injuries that got worse over time",
    "session_id": "user_123",
    "include_reasoning": true,
    "filters": {"categories": ["injury"], "timeframe": "recent"}
}

# Response with full reasoning trace
{
    "answer": "Equipment-related injuries show concerning trends...",
    "reasoning_steps": [
        {"step": 1, "action": "search", "query": "equipment injury"},
        {"step": 2, "action": "trend_analysis", "results": "..."}
    ],
    "sources": [...],
    "confidence": 0.89
}
```

#### **Additional Endpoints**
```python

## 🎯 **User Experience Design**

### **Target User Personas**

#### **1. Fitness Enthusiast (Primary)**
- **Goal**: Find specific answers to fitness questions
- **Pain**: Google gives generic advice, not community insights
- **Value**: Discover real user experiences and solutions

#### **2. Business Stakeholder (Secondary)**  
- **Goal**: Understand customer needs and market trends
- **Pain**: Manual analysis of customer feedback is slow
- **Value**: Automated insights from unstructured customer data

#### **3. Technical Evaluator (Portfolio)**
- **Goal**: Assess ML engineering capabilities
- **Pain**: Most demos show toy problems, not real systems
- **Value**: See production-quality implementation with real data

### **User Journey Optimization**

#### **First-Time User (30 seconds)**
```
Landing → Example Query → Instant Results → "Wow, this works!"
```

#### **Returning User (2 minutes)**
```
Question → Agent Chat → Multi-step Analysis → Actionable Insights
```

#### **Power User (10 minutes)**
```
Complex Query → Custom Filters → Trend Analysis → Export Results
```
