**Deliverable**: `stage-3-agent/tools/` with standardized tool interfaces
```python
# Expected capabilities
tools = [SearchTool(), ClusterTool(), CategoryTool(), TrendTool()]
agent = Agent(tools=tools)
```

### üß≠ **Chunk 11: ReAct Reasoning Loop**
**Learn**: Reason + Action + Observation + Repeat pattern  
**Practice**:
- Agent reads complex user goals
- Plans multi-step workflows
- Executes tools and interprets results
- Iterates until complete answers

**Deliverable**: `stage-3-agent/reasoning/react_agent.py`
```python
# Expected capabilities
result = agent.solve("Find equipment-related injuries that got worse over time")
# Agent: Search ‚Üí Filter ‚Üí Trend ‚Üí Analyze ‚Üí Report
```

### üíæ **Chunk 12: Conversation Memory**
**Learn**: State management and context preservation  
**Practice**:
- Maintain conversation history
- Filter follow-up queries within prior results
- Build session-aware interactions

**Deliverable**: `stage-3-agent/memory/conversation_manager.py`

## üèÜ **Final Vision: Intelligent Fitness Assistant**

By completion, this agent will:
- **Understand** complex fitness questions across multiple domains
- **Reason** through multi-step problems requiring several tools
- **Discover** hidden patterns and trends in community discussions  
- **Communicate** findings clearly to both technical and non-technical users
- **Scale** to handle hundreds of thousands of documents efficiently

This transforms from a "semantic search demo" into a "production AI agent" - exactly the kind of project that stands out in ML engineering portfolios.

## üîÑ **Iteration Philosophy**

Each stage builds incrementally:
1. **Get it working** with minimal viable implementation
2. **Make it useful** by solving real user problems  
3. **Make it robust** with proper error handling and edge cases
4. **Make it beautiful** with great UX and clear documentation

**Focus on completion over perfection** - a working agent beats perfect individual components.
